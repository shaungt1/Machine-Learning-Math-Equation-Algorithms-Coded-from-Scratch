# **Machine Learning Math Equations to Python Code**

> This notebook is a project I started in Graduate school to help me when coding machine learning algorithms. This project is ongoing and is an attempt to code out ALL machine learning algorithms from scratch with only basic libraries such as Numpy and pandas.

> The books used to reference most of the machine learning algorithms can be obtained from the author's site for free. This project attempts to code out and walk through each method to programming these algorithms from scratch
